## Technical Summary  

The Quran App is built with a focus on maintainability, performance, and a modular design using modern Flutter best practices:  

### 1. Installation & Setup  
- **Prerequisites:** Requires a minimum Flutter SDK version of 3.22.2.  
- **Getting Started:**  
  - Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kaikoga45/quran.git
    ```
  - Open the project in Visual Studio Code.  
  - Ensure an emulator (or physical device) is running.  
  - Launch the application directly from VS Code.  

### 2. Architecture & Dependency Injection  
- **Clean Architecture:** Follows a structured architecture divided into Presentation, Domain, and Data layers.  
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes the `Get_it` package to manage dependencies effectively, ensuring a decoupled and testable codebase.  

### 3. Audio Player Implementation  
- **Custom Native Code:** Instead of relying on third-party packages, the audio player is implemented using custom native code.  
  - **iOS:** Uses Swift with AVPlayer.  
  - **Android:** Uses Kotlin with MediaPlayer.  
- **Method Channel Integration:** Communicates between Flutter and native code using method channels, providing seamless integration and efficient performance.  

### 4. State Management  
- Implements the BLOC (Business Logic Component) pattern to manage state, promoting a clear separation between business logic and UI.  

### 5. Testing  
- Implements selected **unit and widget tests** using the AAA pattern for structured testing practices, showcasing an understanding of test implementation in Flutter. 
- The naming convention for tests follows the Microsoft approach, consisting of three parts: the name of the method being tested, the scenario under which the method is being tested, and the expected behavior when the scenario is invoked.

### 6. Code Quality & Design Principles  
- Adheres to the Separation of Concerns (SoC) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, ensuring the code is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.  

### 7. Customization  
- **Custom App Icon:** A uniquely designed custom app icon is implemented for both iOS and Android platforms, contributing to the overall branding of the application.
